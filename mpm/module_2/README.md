# Module 2: Convolutional and recurrent networks

**Aims**

1. Introduce the theoretical bases of convolutional and recurrent networks.
2. Implement the architectures mentioned in the previous point.

**Theory.**

1. Time and space invariance and equivariance. 
2. Convolutional architectures and weight sharing.
3. Recurrent architectures and backpropagation through time.

**Practice.**

1. After reading and [cnn_exo.py](./cnn_exo.py),
2. take inspiration from that code to implement a recurrent neural network and apply it to the same task.
3. Collect the results produced by the MLP-, CNN-, and RNN-based implementations and compare them in a table and suitable plots. See [comparison.md](./comparison.md) for a template.
