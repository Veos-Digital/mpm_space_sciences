# Module 2: Convolutional and recurrent networks

**Aims**

1. Introduce the theoretical bases of convolutional and recurrent networks.
2. Implement the architectures mentioned in the previous point.

**Theory.**

1. Time and space invariance and equivariance. 
2. Convolutional architectures and weight sharing.
3. Recurrent architectures and backpropagation through time.

**Practice.**

1. Implement a convolutional and a recurrent model, and test them on the [exoplanet dataset](../../data/exoplanet). For loading the dataset use these [helper functions](../data_management/exoplanet.py).
